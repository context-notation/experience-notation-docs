## File Format

All examples follow the EBNF structure described in the [language specification](../spec/ebnf.md). Where applicable, comments are included inline to clarify design choices.

These examples can be adapted, extended, or modularised for your own domain-specific applications.

## How to Use

* Copy and edit them as a starting point for your own `.expn` files
* Compare styles and scenarios to see how different constructs are applied
* Pair them with the [Validation Guide](../spec/validation.md) to check correctness
